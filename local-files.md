# Playing Local Files

HISPlayer Android for Unity can playback local content, both from the device's storage and Unity Streaming Assets.
In addition, Android’s devices need permission for using some features such as exploring or using the device’s folders and files. Asking for permissions can be configured following [Configure Unity for Android](./setup-guide.md#Configure-Unity-for-Android).
