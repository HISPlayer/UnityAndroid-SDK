# Audio PCM Retrieval

To get the audio data, itâ€™s required to set **UnityAudio** property to True through Unity editor or script, and you can choose either using **GetAudioData** or **FillAudioData** API. 
Please refer to the sample package which consists of the following Unity scenes:
- HISPlayerOVROverlayFillAudioSample: Sample utilizing FillAudioData API by passing the float[] data from each Unity Audio Source OnAudioFilterRead which the data buffer will be filled automatically. To check the APIs usage, please refer to all scripts in HISPlayerMetaQuestSample\Scripts\Sample\Audio\FillAudioSample.
- HISPlayerOVROverlayGetAudioSample: Sample utilizing GetAudioData API in Unity Audio Source OnAudioFilterRead for center channel, and the new audio data is shared to other channel classes. The new audio data will be copied to the float[] data of OnAudioFilterRead for each channel. To check the APIs usage, please refer to all scripts in HISPlayerMetaQuestSample\Scripts\Sample\Audio\GetAudioSample.
