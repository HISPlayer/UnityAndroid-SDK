# URP (Universal Render Pipeline)

In Unity there is a plugin available from the Unity Package Manager for using several options of shader for our material components. 
For installing in your project just go to **Window > Package Manager**, select  the **Packages: Unity Registry**, look for "Universal RP" and install it.

Create a material and check the "Inspector" window. You will see a section named **Shader** in the top part of the window. Just click on it and select the desire shader.
