#### int GetAudioCount(int playerIndex)
Obtain the number of audio of a  certain stream. The playerIndex is associated with the index of the element of Multi Stream Properties, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.
   
#### string GetAudioID(int playerIndex, int audioTrackIndex)
Obtain the ID of a certain audio of a certain player. The playerIndex is associated with the index of the element of Multi Stream Properties, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.

#### string GetAudioLanguage(int playerIndex, int audioTrackIndex)
Obtain the language of a certain audio of a certain player. The playerIndex is associated with the index of the element of Multi Stream Properties, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.

#### void SelectAudioTrack(int playerIndex, int audioTrackIndex)
Select a certain audio-track of a certain stream to be used. Before using this functions is recommended to use GetAudioTrackList in order to know all the information about the audio-tracks. The playerIndex is associated with the index of the element of Multi Stream Properties, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.

#### void EnableABR(int playerIndex)
Enables the ABR to change automatically between tracks. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.

#### void DisableABR(int playerIndex)
Disables the ABR to prevent the player from changing tracks regardless of bandwidth. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.

#### bool IsPlaying(int playerIndex)
Check whether the certain player is playing. Returns True if the player is playing. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.

#### float[][] GetAudioData(int playerIndex, int sampleSizePerChannel)
Get the audio PCM data of each channel in float array. The order of the channel is the same as the order of the stream's audio channel layout, e.g. C L R Ls Rs. The **playerIndex** is the index of the player in multistream properties, the **sampleSizePerChannel** is the requested data size of each audio channel. Please use this API when **UnityAudio** is set to true.

#### void FillAudioData(int playerIndex, float[] audioData, int channelIndex)
Fill the audio buffer with new audio PCM data. The **playerIndex** is the index of the player in multistream properties. The **audioData** is the audio buffer that will be filled with new audio data. The **channelIndex** is the index of the audio channel. The order of the channel index must be the same as the order of the stream's audio channel layout, e.g. C=0, L=1, R=2, Ls=3, Rs=4. Please use this API when **UnityAudio** is set to true.

#### int GetAudioSessionId(int playerIndex)
Provide the audio session identifier. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.

#### void InitCacheInstance(long maxCacheSize = 150 * 1024 * 1024L)
Only in SDK v3.4.3. Initialize the Cache Instance in order to use all the cache API. It can be called before or after SetUpPlayer(). In the case of overriding the Awake() function, InitCacheInstance must be called after calling base.Awake(). The maxCacheSize indicates the maximum permitted size by the cache in bytes. 150 MB will be set by default (150 * 1024 * 1024L bytes).

#### void AddURLToCache(string url)
Only in SDK v3.4.3. The cache must be initialized before using this function. Given the URL, a miminum amount of data will be stored in cache in order to initialize the video faster when it's needed. Once the video is loaded and played, it will continue caching the remaining fragments of the video. Live and Local video contents are not supported. In the case the cache folder is full, the least recently used old files will be removed when new data is downloaded following the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache policy.

#### void RemoveURLFromCache(string url)
Only in SDK v3.4.3. The cache must be initialized before using this function. Removes the given URL from the cache if exists. Live and Local video contents are not supported. In the case the cache folder is full, the least recently used old files will be removed when new data is downloaded following the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache policy so it's possible the cached data from AddUrlToCache doesn't exist anymore.

#### bool IsURLCached(string url)
Only in SDK v3.4.3. The cache must be initialized before using this function. Determines if the given URL is cached. In the case the cache folder is full, the least recently used old files will be removed when new data is downloaded following the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache policy so it's possible the cached data from AddUrlToCache doesn't exist anymore.
  
#### long GetRemainingCacheSpace() 
Only in SDK v3.4.3. The cache must be initialized before using this function. Retrieves the remaining cache space in bytes.

#### void FlushCacheFolder()
Only in SDK v3.4.3. The cache must be initialized before using this function. Free the cache folder. If a video was loaded from using the cache data, it will continue downloading the new fragments into the cache folder after the flushing is completed.
