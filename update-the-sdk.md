# Update the SDK

Through this guide, you will be introduced how to update the SDK if you already have installed the SDK previously. Please, restart the Editor before continuing.

## Remove Old Package

Remove the previous HISPlayer SDK package from Unity Package Manager.

**Window > Package Manager > Packages - HISPlayer > HISPlayer SDK > Remove**

## Import New package

Importing the new package is the same as importing other normal packages in Unity. 
Select the package of HISPlayer SDK and import it.

**Assets > Import Package > Custom Package > HISPlayerSDK.unitypackage**

By selecting Android target 33, Unity is going to ask you to update (in the case you don't have the SDK 33 installed). Please, press "Update Android SDK" button.

## Update License Key
If you received a license key from HISPlayer, please input the license key in the License Key field.

</p>

If the license key is not valid, the player wonâ€™t work and will throw an error message. License key is not required for Unity Editor usage.

## Check Material and Shader
After updating the SDK, check whether you have a shader error that is attached to the material. For example as image below:

</p>

If you have this issue, please re-attach the correct shader to the material.
